Goal: Create a semi-functioning convolutional neural network in a short amount of time (numpy allowed)

Steps: 
1) Import and process an image
2) Take matrix from image and pump it through the layers

Creation steps: 
1) Create a matrix class for each layer of nodes
2) create classes for the following types of layers that take a matrix and output a matrix:
  - convolution
  - pooling (of various types)
  - fully connected dense layers
